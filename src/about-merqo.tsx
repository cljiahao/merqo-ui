        Why Merqo
      </h1>

      <div className="space-y-4 leading-relaxed text-foreground/90">
        <p>Merqo started at a wedding, in the queue for a coffee cart.</p>
        <p>
          There was no queue number, no order system, just a crowd pressing
          in on the vendor, people cutting in to order faster, and the
          vendor taking it because there was nothing else to do. Finished
          drinks went onto a table with a name scrawled on the cup, and
          guests wandered up to pick through them looking for theirs, not
          exactly hygienic, and the hot drinks were going cold and the iced
          ones watery by the time anyone claimed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          That mess is where <span className="font-medium text-foreground">qkit</span> came
          from: a live queue and order system a small vendor can run with
          no app for the customer and no extra hardware to buy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Merqo grew out of qkit to be the shared home for the rest of the
          family, <span className="font-medium text-foreground">loopkit</span> for
          stamp-card loyalty, <span className="font-medium text-foreground">paykit</span> for
          PayNow and payment tracking, and more kits after, all under one
          account, one sign-in, one dashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Merqo is run by Lee Jia Hao Clarence, trading as Merqo (sole
          proprietorship, ACRA registration pending). Every kit is built
          for the same kind of vendor as that coffee cart: small, busy,
          and better off spending time on the product, not the queue.
